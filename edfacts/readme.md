# Educational Assesments Data


 Contains district-level achievement results for state assessments in mathematics
    and reading or language arts, by grade. It includes the number of students who completed
    each assessment for whom a proficiency level was assigned and the proficiency share.
    The proficiency share is reported as a range, unless there are more than 300 students
    in the subgroup, with the magnitude of the range decreasing as the number of students
    reported increases. States can change their statewide assessments, academic standards,
    or thresholds for proficiency levels, leading to changes in the proficiency share from
    year to year.
